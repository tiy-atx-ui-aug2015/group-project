# April 7th Group Project

## Description
No developer or designer works in a vacuum. We all need to collaborate with teammates in our day to day work. Working effectively in a team is not as easy as it sounds, but like everything else, it just takes some practice. Over the next four days you will work in groups to build **best of** a web application. This is an excellent opportunity to build out a great portfolio piece, become more comfortable with git branching and merging, and work in a team!

## Explorer Mode
To begin, one frontend member of your team should create a new repo using Jess's basic webpack setup. The frontender should [invite all of your team members as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) so that they can push to the repo. Other frontend and design students should pull (don't fork) the newly created repository onto their computer and `cd` into the directory where the repo lives. Then run the `npm install` command (this could take a while to finish so I recommend that you do it as early as possible).

The backend student(s) will create an entitely separate repository.
